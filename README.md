# Disclaimer  
Honestly all of this is garbage and mostly unfinished. Just posting this as a proof of no viruses or me actually changing the game.

# TAB memory access
Meme tool.   
Up to you if you want to trust this stuff. Might crash or display some weird stuff on non english version of the game. Mayor effects are editable through tab_mayors.json file.

+ Adds mayors to text file (filename.txt in the same folder)
+ Renames soldier to Bob and edits his description
+ Changes radar name
+ Ctrl-P for togglable beholder and op quarry and stats in console (turning beholder off requires to reload the map, stats work nicely only before first autosave)
+ Ctrl-I removes rain and darkening on borders
+ Ctrl-N is Woweeeeee

If you want to try keybind modification: dismiss all units and keybinds in submenus on CC (same keybind as menu itself, means button for colonists is always for 1 row, 1 column).
+ Everything else thats above
+ This one prone to crashing

# Cheat engine table
Has some random addresses used throughout the creation of the tool and somewhat deciphered structures. If data is incomprehensible due to being empty while i tested, it might require recreation.
